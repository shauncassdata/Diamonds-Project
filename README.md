# Diamonds Project

This project was submitted as my final project for my STAT 684 Statistical Consulting class at Texas A&M University.
The Diamonds data set for this project was procured from my professor Scott Crawford, but it also comes included as part of the ggplot2 package in R. 

## Description

The Diamonds data set contains the features and prices of 53,940 round cut diamonds.
The goal of the project was to accurately predict the price of round cut diamonds using this data set.
The data set was cleaned and analyzed using R and the tidyverse ecosystem of packages.
Models were built using the Tidymodels ecosystem of packages and the final model used was a random forest model using the Ranger engine. 
The final report and final presentation as they were originally submitted are included for reference.
