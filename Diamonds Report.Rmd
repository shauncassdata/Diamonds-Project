## About the Data

The Diamonds data set was originally procured by requesting the data set from Dr. Crawford at Texas A&M. Upon further inspection, it was realized that this data set was a common data set used for learning how to make exploratory graphics and perform rudimentary inference. This data set comes standard in the ggplot2 package and includes a desciption of the data that we have reproduced in table 1. 

The Diamonds data set contains the the characteristics of 53,940 round cut diamonds. The variables associated with each diamond are as follows: price (in US Dollars), carat (weight), Cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal), Color (D (best) to J (worst)), Clarity (I1 (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best), x (length in mm), y (width in mm), z (depth in mm), depth (total depth percentage), and table (total table percentage). Cut, color, and clarity were ordered categorical variables as described in table 1 while the rest were numerical variables. Based on the data description and the use of the Diamonds data set in other reports, the data was believed to contain independent observations and the methods used in this report treated each observation as independent of one another. 

```{r Diamonds description table, echo=FALSE}
ddf <- data.frame("Variable" = c("price", "carat", "cut", "color", "clarity", "x", "y", "z", "depth", "table"),
                  "Description" = c("Price in US dollars ($326–$18,823)",
                                    "Weight of the diamond (0.2–5.01)",
                                    "Quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)",
                                    "Diamond colour, from D (best) to J (worst)",
                                    "A measurement of how clear the diamond is (I1 (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best))",
                                    "Length in mm (0–10.74)",
                                    "Width in mm (0–58.9)",
                                    "Depth in mm (0–31.8)",

There exists two primary graders of diamonds: the Gemological Institute of America (GIA) and the American Gem Society (AGS). Both use the 4Cs to characterize a faceted diamond:color, clarity, cut, and carat weight. Both have similar grading scales for color and clarity, and only slightly differ on the grading for cut. The GIA is used as the main reference for the remainder of this report.

```{r GIA color image, echo=FALSE, out.extra='trim={0 4.5cm 0 4cm},clip', fig.cap="GIA color scale."}
GIAcolor <- image_read("Figures/GIA_color_scale.jpg")
plot(GIAcolor)

```

The GIA scale for the color of a diamond ranges from the top grade "D" (colorless) to the worst grade "Z" (light yellow) (Figure 1). The diamonds in the data set used only ranged from "D" to "J" meaning that that there may be diamonds with a worse color than the ones in this data set such that the predictive model created would not yield accurrate predictions. 

```{r GIA clarity image, echo=FALSE, out.extra='trim={0 4.5cm 0 4cm},clip', fig.cap="GIA clarity scale."}
GIAclarity <- image_read("Figures/GIA_clarity_scale.jpg")
plot(GIAclarity)

```

The clarity scale that the GIA grades a faceted diamond ranges from the best grade Flawless to the worst grade I3 (figure 2). Inclusions are imperfections usually caused by the heat and pressure that become apparent with the use of a microscope. An example would be a mineral crystal within the diamond itself or even a break in the gemstone. The Diamonds data set only contained diamonds with a clarity that ranged from Internally Flawless (IF) to the first level of Included (I1) so again there may be diamonds with a clarity of Flawless, I2, or I3 for which the predictive model created would not yield accurate predictions.

```{r GIA cut image, echo=FALSE, out.extra='trim={0 5cm 0 4cm},clip', fig.cap="GIA cut scale."}
GIAcut <- image_read("Figures/GIA_cut_scale.jpg")
plot(GIAcut)

```

The GIA scale for the cut of a diamond depends on how the diamond interacts with light and ranges from the best grade Excellent to the worst grade Poor. The cut of the diamonds in the data set ranged from the best grade Ideal to the worst grade Fair. Both scales slightly differ, but each contains five levels. It is unsure if each level directly translates to one another. It may be that the diamond is graded using a variation of the American Gem Society scale as seen in figure ?; however, the scale in the diamonds data set still differs slightly. Further investigation may be needed before using the predictive model on diamonds using either the GIA or AGS cut scale.



```{r AGS cut scale, echo=FALSE, out.extra='trim={0 4.5cm 0 4cm},clip', fig.cap="AGS cut scale."}
AGScut <- image_read("Figures/AGS_cut_scale.png")
plot(AGScut)

```


Figure ? illustrates the anatomy of a typical cut diamond. The top horizontal facet of a diamond is called the table and the table size as used in the data set is the percentage of the length of this facet compared to the average of x and y (the average girdle diameter). The total depth as used in the data set is the percentage of the overall depth relative to the average girdle diameter.


```{r GIA diamond anatomy image, echo=FALSE, out.extra='trim={0 3.2cm 0 3.5cm},clip', fig.cap="GIA anatomy of a diamond."}
GIAanatomy <- image_read("Figures/GIA_anatomy_of_diamond.jpg")
plot(GIAanatomy)

```

The data was analyzed and predictve model was built using the statistical programming language R within Rstudio along with the following packages: tidyverse, GGally, tidymodels, doParallel, parallel, and vip. 

## Missing values and Outliers

The data initially had no missing values, but upon further inspection it was found that there were 20 rows where either the x, y, or z measurement had a value of zero. These zero values were replaced with missing values (NA in R) as it would not be possible for a round cut diamond to have zero length, width, or depth. 12 of these rows only contained one variable with a missing value: the z variable. Because total depth percentage, x, and y were not missing and the total depth percentage by definition was a calculation using x, y, and z, we thought it was appropriate to replace these 12 missing z values using the following formula derived from the total depth percentage calculation:
$$z=\frac{depth\%*(x+y)}{2*100}$$

The calculated z value was rounded to the second decimal place to match the format of the other z values in the data set. 

Additionally, two observations were found where y (width in mm) was abnormally larger than x (length in mm). Since round cut diamonds are cut diamonds where x and y are supposed to be relatively close to each other, it is highly unlikely that y would be six to seven times greater than x as seen in table 2. Also, the depth (z) of the diamond tends to be smaller than the average of x and y and round cut diamonds having greater than 100% depth percentage seems extremely unlikely as a round cut diamond is considered poor once its depth percentage is greater than 70.9% (Figure 1).

![GIA total depth percentage grading for round cut diamonds](Figures/gia_totaldepth_table.PNG)

```{r abnormally large ys, echo=FALSE}
y11_idsdiamonds %>%
  kable(format = "latex", align = "c",
        caption = "Abnormally large values of y in the Diamonds data set.")
```

Likewise, using GIA's $Facetware^{(R)}$ which compares proportions of round cut diamonds to 38.5 million proportion sets, the highest total depth percentage we were able to acheive using a given set of parameters was 83.8% with a typical error of 0.2% - 0.3%. Examining table 2 further, we also saw that the z value was extremely close in value to x. Based on this information it was decided that the z values in table 2 were actually supposed to be the y values. These two observations were corrected by replacing the y values with the given z values and calculating new z values using the same formula as before.

Two other observations were found where the depth (z) was greater than the average of x and y (table 3). These observations were also corrected so using the same z formula as before.
```{r zhigh diamonds, echo=FALSE}
zhigh_idsdiamonds %>%
  kable(format = "latex", align = "c",
        caption = "Diamonds where depth (z) is greater than the average diameter.")
```

To find additional discrepancies in the data, the total depth percentage was calculated for all other observations using the formula in table 1. There were obvious differences between the calculated and recorded total depth percentages as seen in figure 2. It was found that there were 120 observations with a 1% difference or more between the recorded and calculated total depth percentage. Going further, there were 18 observations with a 10% difference or more between the recorded and calculated total depth percentage. The x and y features of these 18 observations noticeably similar with x ranging from 0.75 t0 1.62 times the size of y. The z values were again suspected to be the reason for the noticeable difference between the recorded and calculated total depth percentages for these 18 observations. The z values were thus replaced using the same formula as before. To avoid possibly biasing the data, any remaining observations that had a difference between the recorded and calculated total depth percentage were left as is. 

```{r recorded vs calculated depth, echo=FALSE}
rec_calc_total_depth %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  ggally_points(aes(x = temp_depth, y = depth)) +
  geom_abline(aes(slope = 1, intercept = 0, color = "red"), linetype = "dashed") +
  xlab("Calculated Total Depth Percentage") +
  ylab("Recorded Total Depth Percentage") +
  ggtitle("Recorded vs. Calculated Total Depth Percentage") +
  scale_color_manual(name = "Ratio", values = c("red" = "red"), labels = "1:1") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::label_percent(accuracy = 1, scale = 1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_percent(accuracy = 1, scale = 1))+
  theme_bw() 
```


After cleaning the data, only eight observations in total remained that contained missing values. Seven of the observations had missing values in x, y, and, z, while the last observation had only missing values in x and z. It was decided to keep these observations instead of deleting them in order to retain as much data as possible. A bagged tree imputation method with 25 trees was implemented programatically using the step_impute_bag() function in the recipes package. This method was chosen as a tree can be constructed in the presence of other missing data, trees generally have good accuracy, and they do not extrapolate outside the bounds of the training data. Bagged tree imputation methods also provide reasonable values with a lower computational cost than random forest imputation methods (Kuhn feature engineering). The method was implemented in such a way to avoid data leakage e.g. the preprocessing was done within each fold of the 10-fold cross validation.

# Examining the Cleaned Data

The response variable for the Diamonds data set was decided to be the price in US dollars for each diamond. 
```{r price and log price, echo=FALSE}
a <- diamonds %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = price)) +
  geom_density(size = 1.05, fill = "steelblue", alpha = 0.8) +
  ggtitle("Distribution of the Diamonds' Price") +
  xlab("Price (US Dollars)") +
  ylab("Density") +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(price), color = "Mean"), linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = quantile(price, 0.5), color = "Median"), linetype = "twodash") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::label_dollar()) +
  scale_color_manual(name = "", values = c(Mean = "deeppink1", Median = "darkorchid1")) +
  theme_minimal()

b <- diamonds %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = log(price)))  +
  geom_density(size = 1.05, fill = "steelblue", alpha = 0.8) +
  ggtitle("Distribution of the Diamonds' Price", subtitle = "Price is natural log transformed") +
  xlab("Price (log US Dollars)") +
  ylab("Density") +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(log(price)), color = "Mean"), linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = quantile(log(price), 0.5), color = "Median"), linetype = "twodash") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::label_dollar()) +
  scale_color_manual(name = "", values = c(Mean = "deeppink1", Median = "darkorchid1")) +
  theme_minimal()

c <- a / b & theme(legend.position = "right")
c + plot_layout(guides = "collect") +
  plot_annotation(caption = "Figure 3: Distribution of price and its natural log transformation.",
                  theme = theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0.5)))
```

Price had a heavily right-skewed distribution as noted in figure 3 with a sample mean of \$3932.8 and a sample median of \$2401. Price was natural log transformed so that no diamonds would be predicted to have a negative value of price and any errors in predicting the more expensive diamonds would not have a disporportionate influence on the model.

The other numerical features of the diamonds were also examined as seen in figure 4 and figure 5.
```{r dist of carat table and depth, echo=FALSE}
d <- diamonds %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = carat)) +
  geom_density(size = 1.05, fill = "red3", alpha = 0.8) +
  xlab("Weight (Carat)") +
  ylab("Density") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of the Diamonds' Weight (Carat)") +
  theme_minimal()

e <- diamonds %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = depth)) +
  geom_density(size = 1.05, fill = "violet", alpha = 0.8) +
  ggtitle("Distribution of the Diamonds' Total Depth Percentage") +
  xlab("Total Depth (%)") +
  ylab("Density") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::label_percent(scale = 1)) +
  theme_minimal()

f <- diamonds %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = table))   +
  geom_density(size = 1.05, fill = "green4", alpha = 0.8) +
  ggtitle("Distribution of the Diamonds' Table Percentage") +
  xlab("Table (%)") +
  ylab("Density") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::label_percent(scale = 1)) +
  theme_minimal()

d / e / f + plot_annotation(caption = "Figure 4: Distribution of carat, total depth percentage, and table percentage.",
                  theme = theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0.5)))
```

Like price, carat appeared to be right-skewed while the total depth percentage and table percentage were fairly symmetrical. On the other hand, the distributions of x and y were similar which was to be expected for round cut diamonds. The distribution of z was also noticeably centered on smaller values than x or y.

```{r dist of x y and z, echo=FALSE}
g <- diamonds %>%
  select(x, y, z) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x)) +
  geom_density(fill = "turquoise3", alpha = 0.8, size = 1.05) +
  ggtitle("Distribution of the Diamonds' Length") +
  xlab("x (mm)") +
  ylab("Density") +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 11)) +
  theme_minimal()

h <- diamonds %>%
  select(x, y, z) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = y)) +
  geom_density(fill = "deeppink3", alpha = 0.8, size = 1.05) +
  ggtitle("Distribution of the Diamonds' Width") +
  xlab("y (mm)") +
  ylab("Density") +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 11)) +
  theme_minimal()

i <- diamonds %>%
  select(x, y, z) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = z)) +
  geom_density(fill = "palegreen3", alpha = 0.8, size = 1.05) +
  ggtitle("Distribution of the Diamonds' Depth") +
  xlab("z (mm)") +
  ylab("Density") +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 11)) +
  theme_minimal()  

g / h / i + plot_annotation(caption = "Figure 4: Distribution of x, y, and z (excluding eight observations with missing values).",
                  theme = theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0.5)))
```

The proportion of diamonds for each level of cut, clarity and color was also examined (figure 5). The worst levels of cut (Fair), clarity (I1), and color (J) made up a significantly smaller proportion of the data set compared to the other levels. Furthermore, the best level of clarity (IF) was only present in 3.32% of the data. These proportions indicated that predictions on diamonds having these levels may not be as robust due to the relatively small amount of data used to train a model.





```{r dist of cut clarity and color, echo=FALSE}
cut <- diamonds %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = cut)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = ..prop.., group = 1)) +
  xlab("Cut") +
  ylab("Proportion") +
  ggtitle("Proportion of Diamonds Per Cut Type", subtitle = "Sorted from worst (Fair) to best (Ideal)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 7),
        title = element_text(size = 8))

clarity <- diamonds %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = clarity)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = ..prop.., group = 1)) +
  xlab("Clarity") +
  ylab("Proportion") +
  ggtitle("Proportion of Diamonds Per Clarity Type", subtitle = "Sorted from worst (I1) to best (IF)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 7),
        title = element_text(size = 8))

color <- diamonds %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = color)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = ..prop.., group = 1)) +
  xlab("Color") +
  ylab("Proportion") +
  ggtitle("Proportion of Diamonds Per Color Type", subtitle = "Sorted from worst (J) to best (D)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 7),
        title = element_text(size = 8)) 

cut + clarity + color + plot_annotation(caption = "Figure 5: Distribution of cut, clarity, and color.",
                  theme = theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0.5))) +
  plot_layout(nrow = 2)

```

This was was further explored by examining the bivariate proportions for cut, color, and clarity (figure 6). If any two-way interactions existed between these categorical features, then the sparse amount of diamonds for certain combinations of these features may impact the accuracy of a model for future predictions on similar diamonds. For instance, there were only nine diamonds in total with a cut equal to "Fair" and a clarity equal to "IF". Predictions for diamonds similar to these may not be as accurate as the other combinations.

```

When the distribution of the natural log of price was compared across the levels of cut, clarity, and color (figure 7), it became obvious that many of the levels that made up a smaller proportion of the data had a much tighter distribution than the other levels. Some such as the I1 and IF level of clarity also had a fair amount of outliers. This may be due to how the data was sampled and may not be representative of how these types of diamonds are priced. It was determined that depending on importance of these categorical variables, more diamonds with these rarer features may be needed in the future to increase the predictive accuracy of the model created.

```

Bivariate examinations between each numerical predictor, and examinations between the numerical predictors and the response were held off until after splitting the data. This was done to avoid biasing the model using the information from the test set.

## Splitting the data

Before splitting the data, the price was natural log transformed as mentioned in the previous section and the remainder of the report will simply refer to the variable as "price". The data was split using stratified random sampling (stratified on price) and an 80/20 split so that there were 43,156 observations in the training data and 10,784 observations in the test data set. The stratification was done so that random sampling was performed in each of the four quartile bins of price. This was performed in order to avoid having an inordinate amount of observations from the tails of the distribution in the train or test set. The test set was left untouched until the final model was trained on the training data set and predictions were made for the test set.

Pearson correlations were computed for the numerical variables in the training data and multiple variables were found to be highly correlated (figure ?). 

```{r corrplot of train data, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Pearson correlations of numerical variables in training data."}
train_data %>%
  select(price, carat, depth, table, x, y, z) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  ggcorr(label = TRUE) +
  ggtitle("Pearson Correlation of Continuous Variables in Training Data")
```

Pairwise examinations of the numerical variables in training set (figure ?) also found that there existed some nonlinear association between price and many of the numerical predictors. A natural log transformation of carat, x, y, and z corrected this association such that there was both a linear relationship between the response and these predictors, and a linear relationship between these predictors. These transformations would be necessary for any linear predictive model tested. 

```{r scatterplot of numerical vars train data, fig.cap="Bivariate relationships of numerical variables in training data."}
train_data %>%
  select(price, carat, depth, table, x, y, z) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  pairs(main = "Scatterplots of Continuous Variables in Training Data")
```


```{r scatterplot of vars with log trans, fig.cap="Bivariate relationships with natural log transformations."}
train_data %>%
  select(price, carat, depth, table, x, y, z) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  mutate(log_carat = log(carat),
         log_x = log(x),
         log_y = log(y),

## Preliminary models and tuning

As seen in the previous sections, there were two main hurdles to overcome in building an accurate predictive model for this data. The first was that many of the numerical predictors were highly correlated with one another. The second obstacle was that due to the large amount of levels for each categorical variable, there may exist two-way or even three-way interactions that may impact the accuracy of the predictions. The size of the interaction effects was not deemed important for predicting the price, instead these interactions needed to just be considered in building a model.
